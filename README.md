Semantic Face Generation from Natural Language using GANs
A deep learning system that generates realistic human face images from textual descriptions using a multi-stage GAN architecture. This project integrates BERT-based text encoding, StyleGAN2 for image synthesis, and CLIP-based semantic alignment for enhanced accuracy and visual fidelity.

✨ Features
🔤 Text-to-Face Generation using descriptive language inputs

🧠 BERT-based Text Encoder for rich semantic understanding

🎨 StyleGAN2 Backbone for high-resolution image synthesis

🌀 CLIP-Based Feedback Loop for semantic alignment

🧪 Multi-stage refinement for coarse-to-fine face generation

📁 Support for real-time face generation via web UI

Text Input → BERT Encoder → Multi-Stage GAN → Dual Discriminator → CLIP Evaluator → Output Face
Text Encoder: Uses BERT to generate rich embeddings.

Generator:

Stage 1: Low-resolution base face

Stage 2: Mid-level refinement with attention

Stage 3: High-res face synthesis

Discriminators:

Image Discriminator for realism

Text-Image Discriminator for semantic consistency

Evaluator: CLIP compares image-text alignment for better control.
